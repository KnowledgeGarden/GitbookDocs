### Anticipatory System

It is said that all living organisms are _anticipatory_. That is, living creatures construct _models_ of their world and use those models in the context of _sensed information_ to anticipate, and to _act_. An example is the single-celled creature which senses a nutrient in its environment; its model causes it to swim in the direction of increasing signal until it finds what it went to find.

Wikipedia says this about [_Anticipation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticipation_%28artificial_intelligence%29):

> In [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) \(AI\), **anticipation** occurs when an [agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent) makes decisions based on its explicit beliefs about the future. More broadly, "anticipation" can also refer to the ability to act in appropriate ways that take future events into account, without necessarily explicitly possessing a model of the future events.

### NLP
