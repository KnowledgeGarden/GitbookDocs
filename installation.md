# Installation

This installation covers a range of objects in the OpenSherlock ecosystem. The installation begins by a description of installation on a single computer; in fact, development has been conducted entirely on a MacBook Pro with an i7 and 16gb ram. A section will then cover issues related to installing in a distributed manner.

### Requirements

#### Hardware

Recommended: a strong CPU, i3 or better, 8gb ram \(caveat: on a single system installation, memory less than 16gb will reduce the processing power of the system\).

#### Software Support

Java 1.8 or higher

PostgreSQL 9.6 or higher

ElasticSearch 6+

Kafka 1.1.0 \(the current release at this time\)

#### OpenSherlock
